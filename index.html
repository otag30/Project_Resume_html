    <h2>About me</h2>
    <h3>I'm a Software and Data Alchemist!</h3>
    <p>
      I have always been curious about technology and wanted to get hands-on on
      it, and finally got the courage to do so by embarking in an intensive 4
      month full stack software development bootcamp.<br />
      Completely out of my comfort zone, I was able to experiment further and
      expand my creative thinking and problem solving in ways that the very
      highly regulated Pharma Industry doesn‚Äôt allow.<br />
      I have over 20 years product (medicines) development from proof of concept
      to market approval, launch and life cycle, that can be used to develop
      technical solutions that bring added value to customers and users.<br />
      I have robust experience in bridging the gap between technical and
      business needs, with a strong focus on customer-driven innovation and
      data-informed decision-making.<br />I want to expand my experience in AI
      namely prompt engineering and RAG, data engineering, machine learning, and
      started a self-paced online bootcamp in python.
